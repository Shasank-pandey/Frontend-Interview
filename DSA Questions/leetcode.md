## Company specific questions:
- A frog wants to cross a river. The river has a series of stepping stones. The frog starts at position 0 and needs to reach a final position, say position n. The frog can jump a maximum of k steps at a time (e.g., 1, 2, or 3 jumps). How many different ways can the frog reach position n? **[Agoda]**
- Given an array of integers, find all "pivot" elements where all elements to its left are less than or equal to it all elements to its right are greater than or equal to it? **[Agoda]**
